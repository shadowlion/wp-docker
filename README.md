# Wordpress Docker Template

The goal is to have a docker image aimed at local theme and plugin development with fast protoype spinup.

## Installing

```bash
# start the images for MySQL and Wordpress
docker-compose up -d

# access the local server at http://localhost:8000
```

## Development

You can either use the `theme` or `plugin` folder (or both!)
